 # Question 2
 
 Imagine you're creating software for a book publisher.
 
 Your app needs to track the following information for a given book:
 
 - Book name: the name of the book being published
 - Copies sold: the number of copies sold
 - Author name: the name of the book's author
 - Selling price: the suggested price that bookstores should sell the book for
 - Year published: the year that the book was first published in

 **For each piece of information above, create a variable or constant (whatever is more appropriate).**
 
 **Then, use `print()` statements to briefly explain why you chose to use a variable or a constant for each piece of information above.**
 
 */
// Answer question 2 below
let bookName : String
print("The name will always be the same")
var copiesSold : Int
print("The ammount will grow over time")
let authorName : String
print("The name will never change")
var sellingPrice : Double
print("The price has to change sometimes due to the populatity of the book, but theoretically it could be the same forever but then if for example the book looses popularity, the price would have to be set to a lower value to keep the sellings up.")
let yearPublished : Int
print("This will only happen once so it is a constant")
